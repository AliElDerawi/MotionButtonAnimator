# MotionButtonAnimator [![Build Status][ci-image]][ci]

**"A Custom Animated Progress View (Button) app that animates three statuses of the Button: Idle, Loading, and Completed, with a sleek design, also showcasing a clean architecture."**

MotionButtonAnimator is an app designed to help developers craft an animated view for a download button, featuring a custom design and animation. It allows you to control the view's three statuses, Idle, Progress, and Completed, using XML. The project also uses MotionScene to animate views after opening a fragment. This project is part of the **Udacity Android Kotlin Developer Nanodegree Program**.

## Why This Project?

This project showcases the ability to build custom views, work with **Animators** and **MotionScene**, handle fragment navigation, work with dependency injection, and implement a clean and maintainable MVVM architectureâ€”all critical skills for a mid-senior Android developer.

## Main Features of the Project

- **MVVM Architecture**: Implements an MVVM pattern for clean, maintainable architecture.
- **Custom View**: Creates a custom animated view (button) that can change its attributes using XML.
- **MotionScene**: Implements MotionScene to animate views in the download detail fragment.
- **Orientation Support**: Adapts to portrait and landscape orientations without losing data.
- **Notification Handling**: Displays and handles notifications for all Android versions.
- **Modern UI**: Uses a single-activity architecture with multiple fragments.
- **Download Manager**: Uses a download manager to download from a URL.
- **Dependency Injection**: Koin (v4) used for better modularity and testability.
- **Reactive UI**: Uses DataBindingAdapter and Observable for a reactive user experience.

### Some Attributes

| Option Name        | Format  | Description                                          |
| ------------------ | ------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| buttonIdleColor    | `color` | Sets the Idle color of the button                    |
| buttonLoadingColor | `color` | Sets the loading fill color of the button            |
| circleLoadingColor | `color` | Sets the color of the loading circle                 |
| textAllCaps        | `bool`  | Controls button text capitalization (default: false) |
| textStyling        | `enum`  | Choose between normal, bold, italic, bold_italic     |
| cornerSize         | `dimen` | Sets the corner radius of the button                 |
| textSize           | `dimen` | Sets the text size of the button                     |

</div>  

**Here is an example of how to use these attributes in XML:**

```xml
<com.udacity.util.AnimatedProgressButton
    android:layout_width="wrap_content"
    android:layout_height="wrap_content"
    app:buttonIdleColor="@color/idle_color"
    app:buttonLoadingColor="@color/loading_color"
    app:circleLoadingColor="@color/circle_color"
    app:textAllCaps="false"
    app:textStyling="bold"
    app:cornerSize="8dp"
    app:textSize="16sp" />
```
